BITeamworkSocialOAuth
=====================

Test environment for connecting to BITeamwork certified social vendors such as Salesforce.com Chatter, Yammer, etc.  Although this repository code base is open source, BITeamwork is not.  This repository contains only code for clients and potential clients of BITeamwork to test the ability to connect via OAuth to a social vendor system from the their own infrastructure, behind firewall or otherwise, which will reflect the ability to integrate with a 3rd party enterprise social network once BITeamwork is installed on the client's application server.
